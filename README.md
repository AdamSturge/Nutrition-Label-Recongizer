# Nutrition-Label-Recongizer
Project for CSC2524 Topics in Interactive Computing: Information Visualization

While it is my opinion that the true answer to the current underwhelming nutrition label is to redesign it from the group up I also believe that this will take a long time to make it to market. This application aims to fill part of the requirement in the interim. 

The primary goal for this project was to create a visualization of the data from the current nutrition label that empowers the user to more quickly understand how healthy a particular food item is for them. To this end I focused on creating a clean, simple UI based on android design principles that everyone already understands.

<img src="/readme/consume_food.png" alt="" width="250px" height="450px">

In addition I created a new Health Index (HI) based on the research from the following paper http://jn.nutrition.org/content/137/3/647.full that scored food on a scale from 0 to 1. This information is conveyed to the end user through the color of the consume button
